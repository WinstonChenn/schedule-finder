# Employees Schedule Finding With Preference
This repo implements a simple and easy-to-use python scripts that solves the employees scheduling given preference problem.
## Problem Setup
- There are <b>n</b> days of work and each day has a maximum number of <b>s</b> shifts that need to be scheduled to <b>p</b> employees. 
- Each shift only needs 1 employee to fulfill. 
- Shifts within the same day can sometimes happen at the same time (up to user interpretation) and will need different employees to fulfill. 
- Each employee can also provide a discrete preference bewteen -2 (can't do it) to 2 (I want it) for all the shifts that will be scheduled. 
- One additional employee preference includes the maximum number of back to back days one would like to have shift(s) scheduled.
